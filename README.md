# vmware-automation
Various scripts used to configure VMware products via PowerCLI

This repository is meant to be my learning space as well as provide code that is mentioned
in my blog, https://www.vmhomelab.org.  

The scripts are provided As-Is.  I am learning how to use PowerCLI to manage my #HomeLab environment,
but I will always accept feedback and suggestions to get better.
